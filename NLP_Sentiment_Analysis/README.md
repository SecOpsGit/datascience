# Natural Language Processing -- Sentiment Analysis

Social networks and media platforms are challenged with effectively facilitating open conversations. This results in many such communities preventing users from expressing their opinions, giving feedback etc. on their platform. On the other hand, in open forums the possibility of being verbally abused and harassed by strangers online is not a great motivator for people to engage and learn from one another's perspectives.

#### CAUTION!!! You may find content of this dataset *offensive*!

### Goal:

Develop a set of ML models that can accurately classify and flag/remove comments that are toxic, threatening, insulting, hateful and/or obscene in nature. Thereby, enabling users to engage more openly and social media platforms to better facilitate online conversations.
