# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis

Use features like location, length of campaigns, ideal pledge, project categories, etc. to predict campaign outcomes.

### Data Exploration:

###### Questions to answer:

* What's the best length of time to run a campaign?
* What's the ideal pledge goal?
* What type of projects would be most successful at getting funded?
* Is there an ideal month/day/time to launch a campaign?
